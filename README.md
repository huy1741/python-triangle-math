# Triangle Calculator

## Overview

The Triangle Calculator is a Python project designed to analyze and classify triangles based on their coordinates in a 2D plane. This program provides a comprehensive set of functions for working with triangles, including:

- Validating whether the given coordinates form a valid triangle.
- Calculating the lengths of sides AB, BC, and AC, and measuring the angles between them.
- Classifying the type of triangle (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right-angled, obtuse-angled, or acute-angled).
- Computing the area of the triangle.
- Determining the lengths of altitudes from vertices A, B, and C.
- Calculating the lengths of medians starting from points A, B, and C.
- Identifying the coordinates of the centroid and circumcenter of the triangle.

## Usage

The Triangle Calculator allows users to input the coordinates for points A, B, and C, and it performs the calculations to provide detailed information about the triangle.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. Input coordinates for points A, B, and C in the format [Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy].
3. The program will display the results, including side lengths, angles, triangle classification, area, altitudes, medians, centroid, and circumcenter.

Feel free to use this project for educational purposes or in practical applications where triangle analysis is required.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `triangle_calculator.py` script.
