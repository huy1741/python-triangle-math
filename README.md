Triangle Calculator
This Python project is designed to assist in the analysis and classification of triangles using their coordinates. It performs a range of calculations and provides information about a given triangle:

Checking Triangle Validity: Determines if the provided coordinates form a valid triangle.

Side Lengths and Angles: Calculates the lengths of sides AB, BC, and AC, and measures the angles between them.

Triangle Classification: Identifies if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, right-angled, obtuse-angled, or acute-angled.

Area Calculation: Computes the area of the triangle.

Altitudes: Determines the lengths of altitudes originating from vertices A, B, and C.

Medians: Calculates the lengths of medians starting from points A, B, and C.

Centroid and Circumcenter: Provides the coordinates of the centroid and circumcenter of the triangle.

Usage
The user inputs coordinates for points A, B, and C, and the program performs the calculations to provide the details mentioned above.

How to Use
Run the Python script.
Input coordinates for points A, B, and C in the format [Ax, Ay, Bx, By, Cx, Cy].
The program will display the results, including side lengths, angles, triangle classification, area, altitudes, medians, centroid, and circumcenter.
Feel free to use this project to understand and analyze triangles with ease, whether for educational purposes or practical applications.
